/* Abstraction (Hiding implementation details)
 * Can implement abstraction 2 ways:
 * 1. Abstract class - a class who has at least one abstract method; they cannot be instantiated
 * 2. Interface
 * Loose coupling - 
 * 
 * 
 * Up-casting and down-casting:
 * down-casting: child reference points to parent object (happens by default)
 * up-casting: parent reference points to child object
 */

/* Interface :
 * - methods are by default public
 * - methods are abstract by default
 * - cannot write constructor in interface
 * - when doing inheritance, use keyword implements
 * - after java 8 can write concrete methods by using default keyword
 * */

/* Abstract class:
 * - has a constructor
 * - cannot be instantiated
 * - can modify variables in parent class through constructor
 * - abstract classes and methods have abstract keyword
